<h1>Schlep Blindness</h1>
<h3>January 2012</h3>
<p>There are great startup ideas lying around
    unexploited right under our noses. One reason we don't see them
    is a phenomenon I call schlep blindness. Schlep was originally a
    Yiddish word but has passed into general use in the US. It means a
    tedious, unpleasant task.
</p>
<p>
    No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them. Most hackers
    who start startups wish they could do it by just writing some clever software,
    putting it on a server somewhere, and watching the money roll inâ€”without ever
    having to talk to users, or negotiate with other companies, or deal with other
    people's broken code. Maybe that's possible, but I haven't seen it.
</p>
<p>
    One of the many things we do at Y Combinator is teach hackers about the
    inevitability of schleps. No, you can't start a startup by just writing code.
    I remember going through this realization myself. There was a point in 1995 when
    I was still trying to convince myself I could start a company by just writing code.
    But I soon learned from experience that schleps are not merely inevitable, but pretty
    much what business consists of. A company is defined by the schleps it will undertake.
    And schleps should be dealt with the same way you'd deal with a cold swimming pool:
    just jump in. Which is not to say you should seek out unpleasant work per se, but
    that you should never shrink from it if it's on the path to something great.
